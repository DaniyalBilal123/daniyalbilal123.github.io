		<p>
			This is the uefa team of the year 2015. And i think it is the best choice we could have not made a better choice. Of course since I am arsenal fan i would have liked snsachez or ozil in but still a great team selected.

			Best Team Ever: Arsenal
		</h2> 
		<p>
			<p>Arsenal is just doing amazing so far and on the top of the table.<img src="smiley.gif" alt="Smiley face" width="42" height="42" align="left"> With ozil doing great and with sanchez and giroud on form we are likely to win the match. The problem is leceister city and manchester city chasing down their back.</p>
