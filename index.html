		<p>
			This is the uefa team of the year 2015. And i think it is the best choice we could have not made a better choice. Of course since I am arsenal fan i would have liked snsachez or ozil in but still a great team selected.

			This team is right now on the top of the table. With ozil, the german player of the year with all his assists. Arsene wenger are making sure that we win. Evenn with leceister city an manchester city chasing behind their back.
